Winnitron Template for Construct 2
=============================

This project contains a bunch of preconfigured input events according to the [Winnitron Requirements](https://github.com/winnitron/WinnitronLauncher/wiki/Requirements-for-Winnitron-Games), and a simple layout to test the arcade controls.

This is intended to be used for standalone builds based on NW.js, which unfortunately are not available in the free version of Construct 2.
