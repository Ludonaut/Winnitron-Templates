# Winnitron Templates

A collection of project templates for popular game engines, preconfigured for Winnitron games.

These templates follow the [Winnitron Requirements](https://github.com/winnitron/WinnitronLauncher/wiki/Requirements-for-Winnitron-Games).

See README files in the individual folders for additional info.

## How to contribute

## Needed Templates

We are looking for contributions for:

* Stencyl
* LÃ–VE
* Clickteam Fusion
* HaxeFlixel
* Monogame
* libGDX
* etc

Right now the Winnitron Launcher can run anything as long as it is a Windows executable file, so we're looking for any engine that can target Windows desktop.

Also templates or build scripts for Electron/NW.js would probably be useful for making arbitrary HTML5 games Winnitron compatible.
