# Winnitron Templates

A collection of project templates for popular game engines, preconfigured for Winnitron games.

These templates follow the [Winnitron Requirements](https://github.com/winnitron/WinnitronLauncher/wiki/Requirements-for-Winnitron-Games).

See README files in the individual folders for additional info.

## How to contribute

Can't find a template for your favorite game engine here? Make one and submit a pull request.

## Needed Templates

We are looking for contributions for:

* Unreal Engine
* Godot
* Stencyl
* LÃ–VE
* etc

Right now the Winnitron Launcher can run anything as long as it is a Windows executable file, so we're looking for any engine that can target Windows desktop.
